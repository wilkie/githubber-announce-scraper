Finding a proven financial expert that fit our culture wasn't easy, but we were very lucky to find someone special, and now we're incredibly proud to call Vlado a GitHubber.  As the CFO of Yelp for nearly five years, Vlado helped transform the company from a scrappy twenty-two person startup into a thousand person juggernaut. Previous to Yelp, Vlado was a Director of Finance for Yahoo! and spent time at Intel and Ernst & Young.  Keeping up with the growth of GitHub.com and GitHub Enterprise, and helping us plan for the future will be challenges, but just like a fine forty-year scotch, Vlado brings good taste to the table, and the team and I are looking forward to meeting those challenges head on, together.

He'll be making GitHub more awesome just by being here, but we hope he'll also add new features, improve existing features, and whip the codebase into shape.       A former member of the Rails Core team, Rick is a master open source craftsman with nearly 100 public projects on his GitHub profile. Old school Rails developers will recall his classic acts_as_paranoid, acts_as_versioned, acts_as_authenticated, or exception_logger plugins, while new school developers will surely recognize restful_authentication and attachment_fu, two of the most watched projects on GitHub  But he's more than just a Ruby on Railer. Rick writes jQuery plugins, node.js libraries and servers, Rack middleware, GitHub hacks, as well as some crazy experiments.  He co-created Calendar About Nothing, islostonyet, Warehouse (one of the inspirations for GitHub), and Lighthouse before he was the lead developer on Tender, the software that powers GitHub's Support site.  If that's not enough, you can read his blog, his twitter, his tumblr, his code, or catch him on XBox LIVE as technoweenie.  Welcome to the team, Rick!",
