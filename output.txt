As of this weekend, GitHub is now hosting over 4 million repositories for over 2.3 million people. Their stories are our stories.

I am very happy to announce that today is Liz Clinkenbeard's first day as a GitHubber. Liz will be helping us tell the GitHub story while managing our press and media relationships.    You can follow Liz on GitHub and on Twitter.

Several months ago we blogged about how Vicent was helping us develop libgit2, a linkable Git library.  Well, we're proud to announce that Vicent is now a GitHubber!    Vicent was the student in the Google Summer of Code project that I mentored and did an amazing job with the project.  GitHub hired him as a contractor to keep working on the project and now he's accepted a full time job working at GitHub.  Vicent will continue kicking ass on the libgit2 project making sure that it's "fucking fast", as well as other hard core C related stuff.  This may mark the first time that a Google Summer of Code project has fairly directly led to a student dropping out of school, but we're pretty proud of the precedent.  It was just a masters degree, after all.  Check out Vicent on GitHub and on Twitter.

Today marks Aman Gupta's first day as a GitHubber. Years ago, Aman embarked upon a crusade to make Ruby faster, leaner, more concurrent, and more debuggable. Today he brings that expertise to GitHub.       We've already been using Aman's code for years. His work on EventMachine has allowed us to write a routing proxy in Ruby that shuttles gigabytes of data between the frontends and file servers with ease and simplicity. Tools like memprof, gdb.rb, perftools.rb, and rbtrace have finally given Ruby developers fine grained insight into the memory and performance of their Ruby projects. Whether he's disassing MRI or writing killer Rails code, you can count on Aman to take things to the next level.  We're insanely excited that Aman has joined the team, and you can be sure to see his mark on GitHub very soon.  (And don't forget to follow Aman on Twitter and GitHub for additional awesome.)

Today marks Rick "technoweenie" Olson's first day as a GitHubber. He'll be making GitHub more awesome just by being here, but we hope he'll also add new features, improve existing features, and whip the codebase into shape.       A former member of the Rails Core team, Rick is a master open source craftsman with nearly 100 public projects on his GitHub profile. Old school Rails developers will recall his classic acts_as_paranoid, acts_as_versioned, acts_as_authenticated, or exception_logger plugins, while new school developers will surely recognize restful_authentication and attachment_fu, two of the most watched projects on GitHub  But he's more than just a Ruby on Railer. Rick writes jQuery plugins, node.js libraries and servers, Rack middleware, GitHub hacks, as well as some crazy experiments.  He co-created Calendar About Nothing, islostonyet, Warehouse (one of the inspirations for GitHub), and Lighthouse before he was the lead developer on Tender, the software that powers GitHub's Support site.  If that's not enough, you can read his blog, his twitter, his tumblr, his code, or catch him on XBox LIVE as technoweenie.  Welcome to the team, Rick!
